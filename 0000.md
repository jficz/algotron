# Boilerplate

## Description

Most of the `algotron` tasks will be based on a _boilerplate_ script
you will create for this task. We will mostly use simple command line
arguments as a way to pass data to the scripts we will code in `algotron`.

You can code the script in any programming/scripting language you want.
Even though the guide is based on `nodejs`, the principles are very
similar in most other languages and are exactly the same in all common
operating systems.

Please _remember_ that _Algotron_ exercises are created for you to train and
extend your _alorithmic_ skills. That means you **should not use** any stock
functions or libraries that will do the tasks for you. The only functions
you are allowed to use are those explicitly mentioned in the instructions
or Docs.

In here the point is to **get your hands dirty** :)

A few examples of "forbidden" functions:
```js
Array.sort()
Array.find()
Math.max()
Math.min()
```

## Lesson goals

After you're done with this script you will have learned:

  - what are command line arguments (cmdline "args")
  - what is the common structure of args
  - how to run a program with args
  - how to use args in `nodejs`

## Prerequisities

In order to successfully create and test the script you need to:

  - have an idea what _command line_ or _shell_ is
  - how to star a _shell_ in your preferred operating system
  - how to start a `nodejs` script from _shell_
  - how to use "standard output" in the script *)
  - know how to use `arrays`

Note: for the purpose of this exercise terms _command line_|_shell_|_cmd_|_terminal_|_console_
are equal; in reality each one means something slightly different but are often (incorrectly)
used as synonyms. In `algotron` we will use the terms _shell_ and _command line_. A program
that is designed to be run from _shell_ can also be called a "CLI program". _CLI_ means "Command
Line Interface". You probably know other interfaces, like "GUI" or "WebUI". Some programs
have no UI (_User Interface_) - these are usually operating system-level or background programs
users don't interact with directly.

*) if you ever used `console.log()` you already know how to use "standard output" (commonly
abbreivated as _stdout_) - you don't necessarily need to understand what it is but you
are encouraged to figure it out if you don't

## Assignment

Create a `nodejs` script that will:

1. print the number (i.e. count) of cmdline args
2. print *all* cmdline args in sequence, one by one
3. print current program's executable name
4. print the *actual* args
  - 4a: `nodejs`-specific: print just *the script's* args

Fun fact: _print_ here really means _print to stdout_ because we can "print" to other outputs than _stdout_.
By default the OS assigns two outputs to any program: _stdout_ and _stderr_. Programs can create any number
of custom outputs (like files, sockets, pipes, etc).

In `algotron` _print_ will always mean _print to stdout_. Any other output will be described explicitly (if
we ever even get there in `algotron` :) ).

### Test example
```bash
$ node boilerplate.js 1 second myarg3
1: 5
2: node boilerplate.js 1 second myarg3
3: node
4: boilerplate.js 1 second myarg3
4a: 1 second myarg3
```

Note: when one wants to share a _shell_ "session", this is what it usually looks like.
The `$` character means the _command line_, i.e. what user writes in the _shell_ and
presses `<ENTER>`. The rest is what the script _prints_, usually termed "script's output".
This is very similar to what you should actually see in your _shell_ when running the
script.

## Background

Using command line arguments is one of the oldest and most basic forms of passing user data to
an application ever since operating systems came by. It is also arguably the easiest to work
with for both the user and the developer.

Another way to pass data to programs is "interactive input", like `<input>` fields in websites
or CLI programs "prompts". These are mostly useful when the program itself is _interactive_.
In `algotron`, however, we stick to a more _batch_-like, or _non-interactive_ approach meaning
the user only starts the program once and gives it all the data it needs in a single step,
not having to monitor or interact with the program for the duration of its execution.

There is also a counterpart to _standard output_, aptly called _standard input_ (or `stdin`).
Each program has a standard input attached to it by the operating system in the same fashion
standard _outputs_ are attached to it. The difference is that while the program's _outputs_
(plural) are printed to by the program (for example with `console.log()`), standard _input_ 
(singular) can be _read_ by the program. The operating system can easily connect one program's
_output_ to other program's _input_. By default both `stdin` and `stdout` are attached to the
_console_ (the window `shell` runs in). Whatever the program prints to `stdout` is printed by
the console and whatever the user writes in the console (after the program is started) is then
fed to the program's `stdin`. The program then decides what (if anything) to do with the input.

We will not use `stdin` in `algotron` in the first few lessons but we will need it for more
complicated tasks. We will learn how to use `stdin` before we start to rely on it but you are
encouraged to explore it on your own.
