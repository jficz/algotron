# Boilerplate 2

Functions.

## Description

Functions are essential part of higher level programming. Pretty much
every programming language implements functions in one way or another,
including, perhaps not so obviously, assembly languages.

Many algoithms are very hard if not impossible to implement without
using functions.

A function is a named piece of generic code that can be reused anywhere
in the source code just by calling it by its name. 

Function always returns a _value_ which can be used in the code in the same
way as a variable or a literal. In `nodejs` the vaules  `undef` and
`null` are also valid function return values. 


## Lesson goals

After you're done with this script you will have learned:

  - how to define a function with parameters
  - how to call a function
  - how to use a function's return value

## Prerequisities

In order to successfully create and test the script you need to:

  - know stuff from Boilerplate 1
  - have a general idea of what a _value_ is in programming and how it is used
  - know what an _expression_ is in programming (not a hard prerequisity but
    it will help you understand some of the principles)

## Assignment

Create a `nodejs` script that will accept 2 args, henceforth
refered to as `arg1` and `arg2`, and:

0. assume the args are integers
1. create a function called `plus` that accepts two parameters and returns their sum (assume the parameters are integers)
2. print the sum of the two cmdline args using the function - there will be no `console.log()` in the function body!
3. create a function called `max` that accepts two parameters and returns the larger of them (parameters are integers)
4. print the larger number of the two cmdline args using the function - there will be no `console.log()` in the function body!


### Test example
```bash
$ node boilerplate2.js 15 11
1: 26
2: 15
```

## Docs

For a function to be available it first needs to be "declared". Each programming language has a different way to
declare functions but most of them follow similar logic. A function is defined by its name and parameters. In
strong-typed languages, a function definition also contains its return _type_. JavaScript is not a strong-typed
language and therefore any function can return any kind of value.

In `nodejs` (JavaScript) a function is defined using the following notation:
```js
function plus(number1, number2) {
  (...)
  return <expr>;
}
```

This tells the language interpreter to create a function called `plus` which accepts two parameters. Those
parameters _vaules_ can then be accessed _inside_ the function body as variables called `number1` and `number2`.

`return` is optional and it tells the interpreter what will be the function's return vaule. In this case the
value is the value of expression `<expr>`. Most functions will have a `return` statment.

When the interpreter reaches the `return` statement it will immediately terminate the function and return
to the place where the function was called from, replacing the function with the vaule of the expression
`return` had set.

There can be multiple `return` statements in a function. The fisrt one to be reached "wins", the others
are ignored.

A program similar to the assignment can look like this:
```js
function min(n1, n2) {
  if (n1 < n2) {
    return n1;
  } else {
    return n2;
  }
}

const arg = process.argv.slice(2);

let smaller = min(arg[1], arg[2]);

console.log(smaller);
```

A condensed version of the same program can look like this:
```js
function min(n1, n2) {
  return (n1 < n2) ? n1 : n2
}

const arg = process.argv.slice(2);

console.log(min(arg[1], arg[2]));
```

## Background

Functions are essential construction blocks of any program. Functions can call other functions (`console.log()` is
a function for example).
Arrays are the basic dynamic data structure in programing and many algorithm leverage arrays in one way or another.

Arrays are very powerful and can be used to create a more sophisticated data structures like FIFO, LIFO,
binary trees, etc., all of which are very useful in practical programming. We will learn about these
advanced data structures in later `algotron` exercises.
