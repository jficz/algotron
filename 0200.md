# Boilerplate 3

Arrays - create, print, modify

## Description

Many of the `algotron` tasks will leverage arrays in some form.

We need to have a way to create arbitrary arrays to play with
and in this thask we will do just that.

## Lesson goals

After you're done with this script you will have learned:

  - how to create an arbitrarily long array of random Integers
  - how to walk through the array in sequence
  - how to change a value in array

## Prerequisities

In order to successfully create and test the script you need to:

  - know stuff from Boilerplate 1
  - know how to create `arrays`
  - know what is an _integer_, a _real number_ (also called `decimal` or `float` ) and what is the difference between the two from mathematical perspective
  - know what a _cycle_ is (`for`, `while`)
  - knowing what "variable interpolation in string" is might help you a bit

## Assignment

Create a `nodejs` script that will accept 4 args, henceforth
refered to as `arg1` through `arg4`, and:

0. assume all args are numbers (i.e. they can be parsed to Integers by `parseInt()`)
1. create an array called `arr`
2. put `arg1` random Integers from the interval `[0, arg2)` *) to `arr` fields
   (i.e. `arr` length will be equal to `arg1 - 1` and each element will contain a random integer
   from `0` and `arg2 - 1`); use the function `rnd` from the previous assignment 
3. print all `arr` elements one by one, separated by `,` (you will have to use some kind of cycle for this)
4. print a string with `arg3` and `arg4` like this: `position ${arg3} will contain ${arg4}`
5. set `arr[arg3]`'s vaule to `arg4`
6. repeat task 3.

*) this is one of the common mathematical syntaxes to describe an interval (a range) of numbers.
There are many different syntaxes (or "notations") using a combination of parentheses like (), <>, [] or {}.
In `algotron` we will use `[]` and `()` because these conform to the ISO 31-11 notation standard.
The parentheses `()` mean "open-ended" interval while the brackets `[]` "closed-ended" interval.
Open-ended means that the edge number is _not_ part of the interval while close-ended means that the
number _is_ part of the interval. For example, if we consider integers, an interval `[0,5)` means
`{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`, `(1-4)` means `{2, 3}` and `[1-4]` means `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.

> _Extra_: intervals are not limited to integers. Real numbers can form the same type of intervals. Intervals
> of Real numbers are more useful in some cases and we will revisit them in one of the later tasks
> in `algotron`. For now we will only ever deal with Integers.

### Test example
```bash
$ node boilerplate.js 5 10 3 15
1: 2, 7, 0, 4, 1
2: position 3 will contain 15
3: 2, 7, 0, 15, 1
```
Obviously the numbers in your output will be different as they should be random.

Note that the line numbers (`1:`, `2:`, etc.) are part of the scripts output. They're not automatic,
you need to do something like `console.log("1:", "...")` for each line if you want the output lines
to be numbered like this.

> _Extra_: on Linux and Mac (and [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about))
you can also run the script like this to achieve similar output automatically:
```bash
$ node boilerplate2.js arg1 arg2 ... | cat -n
```
> This syntax takes the `stdout` of the script and "pipes" it to another program's `stdin`. In this case
> the other program is called `cat` and has a parameter `-n`. `cat` takes whatever it gets on its
> `stdin` and just prints it on its `stdout`. With `-n` it also adds a line number before each printed
> line.


## Docs

Array values (or fields) can be accessed by their _index_ which is basically a sequence number.

Look at this example:
```js
arr = [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ];

let i = 0;

console.log(arr[1]);
console.log(arr[i]);
console.log(arr[2]);
```

We created an array called `arr` which contains 3 elements, letters `a`, `b` and `c`. Each element
in the array has a unique index which starts from `0`. If you don't mess with the indexes, they're
assigned in sequence. That means in this case the letter `a` is an element of `arr` with the index `0`,
letter `b` has index `1` and letter `c` has index `2`.

Try running this example yourself to see what is printed in the console but make a guess first
and see if you were right.

Note that you don't need to use numbers to access array elements - you can use variables containing
integers as well!

> _Fun fact_: in JavaScript an array can contain a mix of element _types_ meaning one element can
> be an integer and another one a string or float or anything else. In other languages, notably in
> strong-typed languages, an array can usually only contain elements of _the same_ type. The type
> is then defined when the array is created. A more low-level programming languages also sometimes
> require the _length_ of the array to be defined as well. For example:
> ```c
> int arr[10];
> ```
> 
> This is a `C` language's definition of an "array of integers called `arr` with the length of 10".
> This means that the array `arr` can only store integers and only up to 10 of them. It is impossible
> to store anything else than an integer in the array and it is (nearly) impossible to resize the
> array. In JavaScript on the other hand both storing a different type in diotfferent fields and
> resizing the array is as easy as `arr = [0, 'a']; arr[2] = 'another value';`

## Interpolation

Interpolation is a syntax technique which allows you to "interpolate" variables for their values
in-place inside a string. "To interpolate" here means to exchange the variable reference (i.e. it's
name) for its actual value. To interpolate strings in JavaScript you need to use special kind
of quote. As you know, strings in JavaScript are delimited by either `"` or `'`. These to quote
types are equal in JavaScript. If you want to use interpolation, you need to use a third type
of quote, `\`` (a _backtick_). Normal strings behave exactly the same as in `"` and `'` but there's
a twist. You can type `${var_name}` inside the backticked string and the vaule of `var_name` will
be interpolated in-place. For example:
```js
let a=10;
console.log(`A is ${a}`);
```
will print
```
A is 10
```

> _fun fact_: many other languages (most Shells, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Python, to name a few) support interpolation, too.
> But most of them use a slightly different kinds of quotes for that. In most languages which support interpolation
> you can use the `"` (double quote) strings with interpolation but not `'` (single quote, apostrophe) quoted strings.
> The reason JavaScript has a third kind of quote, the _backtick_, is mostly historical - unlike other languages, JavaScript
> was build primarily with HTML in mind and in HTML both types of quotes are equal. For the same reason, they are equal
> in JavaScript. Later people found out that interpolation is a nice thing to have but they couldn't change the behavior
> of either quotes in JavaScrip as it would most likely break most of the programs written in the language. So they introduced
> a third kind of quote just for interpolation.
>
> There's more to the different kinds of quotes in the programming world, not just interpolation, but that's way beyond
> our exercises at this point. And it doesn't even apply to us if we only use JavaScript in our exercises.

 
## Background

Arrays are the basic dynamic data structure in programing and many algorithm leverage arrays in one way or another.

Arrays are very powerful and can be used to create a more sophisticated data structures like FIFO, LIFO,
binary trees, etc., all of which are very useful in practical programming. We will learn about these
advanced data structures in later `algotron` exercises.
