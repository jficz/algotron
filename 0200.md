# Boilerplate 3

Arrays - create, print, modify

## Description

Many of the `algotron` tasks will leverage arrays in some form.

We need to have a way to create arbitrary arrays to play with
and in this thask we will do just that.

## Lesson goals

After you're done with this script you will have learned:

  - how to create an arbitrarily long array of random Integers
  - how to walk through the array in sequence
  - how to change a value in array

## Prerequisities

In order to successfully create and test the script you need to:

  - know stuff from Boilerplate 1
  - know how to create `arrays`
  - know what is an _integer_, a _real number_ (also called `decimal` or `float` ) and what is the difference between the two from mathematical perspective

## Assignment

Create a `nodejs` script that will accept 4 args, henceforth
refered to as `arg1` through `arg4`, and:

1. create an array called `arr` with lenght `arg1`
2. put a random Integer from the interval `[0, arg2)` *) to each `arr` field
3. print all `arr` values one by one, separated by `,`
4. print `arg3` and `arg4` like this: `position $arg3 contains $arg4`
5. set `arr[arg3]`'s vaule to `arg4`
6. repeat task 3.

*) this is one of the common mathematical syntaxes to describe an interval (a range) of numbers.
There are many different syntaxes (or "notations") using a combination of parentheses like (), <>, [] or {}.
In `algotron` we will use `[]` and `()` because these conform to the ISO 31-11 notation standard.
The parentheses `()` mean "open-ended" interval while the brackets `[]` "closed-ended" interval.
Open-ended means that the edge number is _not_ part of the interval while close-ended means that the
number _is_ part of the interval. For example, if we consider integers, an interval `[0,5)` means
`{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`, `(1-4)` means `{2, 3}` and `[1-4]` means `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.

> _Extra_: intervals are not limited to integers. Real numbers can form the same type of intervals. Intervals
> of Real numbers are more useful in some cases and we will revisit them in one of the later tasks
> in `algotron`. For now we will only ever deal with Integers.

### Test example
```bash
$ node boilerplate.js 5 10 3 15
1: 2, 7, 0, 4, 1
2: positin 3 will contains 15
3: 2, 7, 0, 15, 1
```
Obviously the numbers in your output will be different as they should be random.

Note that the line numbers (`1:`, `2:`, etc.) are part of the scripts output. They're not automatic,
you need to do something like `console.log("1:", "...")` for each line if you want the output lines
to be numbered like this.

> _Extra_: on Linux and Mac (and [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about))
you can also run the script like this to achieve similar output automatically:
```bash
$ node boilerplate2.js arg1 arg2 ... | cat -n
```
> This syntax takes the `stdout` of the script and "pipes" it to another program's `stdin`. In this case
> the other program is called `cat` and has a parameter `-n`. `cat` takes whatever it gets on its
> `stdin` and just prints it on its `stdout`. With `-n` it also adds a line number before each printed
> line.


## Background

Arrays are the basic dynamic data structure in programing and many algorithm leverage arrays in one way or another.

Arrays are very powerful and can be used to create a more sophisticated data structures like FIFO, LIFO,
binary trees, etc., all of which are very useful in practical programming. We will learn about these
advanced data structures in later `algotron` exercises.
