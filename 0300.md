# Find maximum value

Finally, first algorithmic task!

Find the largest number in an array.

## Description

Yes, that simple - find the largest number in an array.

You will create the array and print it, too, so you can check that your result is correct.

## Lesson goals

After you're done with this script you will have learned:

  - walk through (or "iterate over") an array

## Prerequisities

In order to successfully create and test the script you need to:

  - know stuff from Boilerplate 3

## Assignment

Create a `nodejs` script that will accept 2 args and:
 
1. create an array called `arr`
2. put `arg1` random Integer from the interval `[0, arg2)` *) to `arr` fields one by one
   (i.e. the length of the array will be `arg1` and each element will contain a random number)
3. print all `arr` values one by one, separated by `,`
4. print the largest number from the array
5. repeat task 4 but this time find a way to use the `max()` function from the boilerplate
   exercises in the solution

Try to reuse as much code from your previous tasks as possible, including functions.

_Remember_ - this is an exercise to practice your algorithmic skills. *Do not* use any
stock functions to help you (like `Math.max()`, `Array.sort()`, etc.), try to figure
out the _alorithmic_ solution to the tasks. In fact *do not* use any _stock functions_ or
libraries other that those explicitly mentioned in the exercises. A _stock_ function
is a function provided to you "for free" by the language itself.

_Bonus_: try to only use a single cycle in the program (meaning you will only iterate
over the array once)

> _Fun fact_: in real world scenarios the arrays can be huge and iterating over the whole
> array can take a _long_ time. That's why programmers try to "optimize" the code to make
> it run faster by getting rid of any steps that are not necessary - for example they
> try to avoid repeating the same tasks (like iterating over an array) if possible

### Test example
```bash
$ node boilerplate.js 5 10
1: 2, 7, 0, 4, 1
2: 7
```
Obviously the numbers in your output will be different as they should be random.

## Background

Finding values in arrays (or in list, dictionaries or other types of data sets) is
one of the most common things programs do.
