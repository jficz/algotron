# Sort array

Sort the elements in an array ascending and descending.

## Description

Sorting is usually the fist "real" algorithmic task programming teachers
give to their students. It is also a very common and quite complex
problem that has many different uses and solutions in the real world.

Imagine a random e-shop - how often do you "sort the goods" by price? ;)

## Lesson goals

After you're done with this script you will have learned:

  - at least one sorting algorithm

## Prerequisities

In order to successfully create and test the script you need to:

  - know stuff from the previous task

## Assignment

Create a `nodejs` script that will accept 2 args and:
 
1. create an array called `arr`
2. put `arg1` random Integers from the interval `[0, arg2)` to `arr` fields
3. print all `arr` values one by one, separated by `,`
4. create a new array called `sortedArrAsc` which will contain all elements from `arr` in ascending order
5. create a new array called `sortedArrDesc` which will contain all elements from `arr` in descending order
6. print the sorted arrays the same way as in task 3

Try to reuse as much code from your previous tasks as possible, including functions.

_Bonus_: try to figure out at least two different ways to sort the arrays. Try to sort the
array `arr` "in place" meaning you will skip tasks 4 and 5 (i.e. do not create any other arrays
besides `arr)

> _Fun fact_: there are many different sorting algorithms, some of them more effective than others.
> The "effectivity" of an algorithm is relative and in many cases depends on what the data looks
> like or what constraints are present - for example a huge array may not even fit in the computer
> memory making it impossible to sort using algorithms that use a copy approach (like in step 4 and 5).

### Test example
```bash
$ node boilerplate.js 5 10
1: 2, 7, 0, 4, 1
2: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7
2: 7, 4, 2, 1, 0
```
Obviously the numbers in your output will be different as they should be random.
